# ColabWorkshop

This exercise is meant to cover a short description of the sites that provide data and Machine learning tools as well as to introduce some of the main principles of using this tools. 

The workshop doesnot aim at describing the algorithms as this was already covered in the lectures. 


As an introduction to this workshop it is recommended to explore the following links


http://read.pudn.com/downloads779/ebook/3085493/Getting%20Started%20with%20TensorFlow.pdf

Tensorflow version 2.0 is relatively new, and links found on google could be pointing to the old version. 


For this Colab-Workshop we will have:
1. Session and overview of sites and basics of tensorflow
2. Exercise on reading data
3. Creating a forecasting model 



This is a general free book of Python and machine learning and although tensorflow in the book is old, the concepts are well described.
